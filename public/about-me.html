<h1>About me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hi, my name is Moises Cardona, and I'll tell you about myself, \
I grew up in El Salvador in a city called San Miguel, 
I made my studies in a school called Liceo San Miguel, 
then I moved to the capital, San Salvador, 
where I began to study Mechatronic engineering at Don Bosco University, 
I left it at the 4th year because I had to move to San Miguel again which is the university I'm studying now, 
I study Software engenering there and now I'm improving my programming skills.
